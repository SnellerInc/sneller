{{ range . }}
// partition{{.Suffix}} performs partition algorithm for given pair of keys
// and indices and the pivot value.
//
// Partition splits input data into two sets: 1) keys less or equal to the
// pivot and 2) keys greater or equal to the pivot.
//
// The procedure takes into account values in range [left:right] (it's a
// closed interval). Returns a subrange which wasn't partitioned. The
// subrange has to be processed further by a scalar procedure.
//
// Preconditions:
// 1. [left:right] forms a non-empty range,
// 2. all keys must not be strictly less nor strictly greater than the pivot.
//
// Postconditions:
// 1. none of keys on the left (before `unprocessed_left`)
//    is greater than the pivot;
// 2. none of keys on the right (after `unprocessed_right`)
//    is less than the pivot.
